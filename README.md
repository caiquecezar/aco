# Ant Colony Optimization Project

## Overview

If you fall into this library. I recommend taking a look at Ant Colony Optimization algorithm theory, for better understanding of this project.

Ant Colony Optimization is an optimization technique that simulates the behavior of ants in nature to solve complex problems, especially those that can be represented as a graph, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), routing in networks, among others. The algorithm is based on indirect communication among ants through the deposition of pheromones on the paths they travel.

This project consists of several classes that implement the essential behavior of the algorithm, but, as the implementation of ACO algorithm depends on the problem to which it will be applied, this library provides some abstract classes for you to implement according to your problem, only after that, you can executes the algorithm behavior and obtains you solution.
